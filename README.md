The National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO) BioPortal contains a comprehensive repository of biomedical ontologies. A HTTP GET request is sent to the NCBO BioPortal server for a set of terms and returns a set of resources (e.g., ontologies, classes) in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. For example, the patient condition “Adenocarcinoma” from the source database was requested as http://data.bioontology.org/search?q=Adenocarcinoma&ontologies=SNOMEDCT. The python package rapidfuzz was used for string matching based on the Levenshtein Distance measurement to calculate the difference between the term and concept label to obtain the best match.

Clinical terms without a corresponding medical vocabulary or concept are checked against the BioPortal to obtain a complete or partial match.

The following code is a condensed and simpler version used in a project.
